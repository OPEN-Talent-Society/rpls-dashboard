## Best Practices

1. **Synthesis Not Summary**: Don't just concatenate - synthesize insights
2. **Executive-Appropriate**: Write for busy decision-makers, not researchers
3. **Actionable**: Every section should drive specific actions
4. **Scannable**: Use bullets, tables, bold for quick reading
5. **Navigation-Focused**: Make it easy to find what's needed when needed
6. **Realistic Timelines**: Provide prep strategies for various time constraints
7. **Iterative**: Mark documents as "living" - update based on use

Remember: The best research package is useless if people can't navigate it. Your job is to make 22 documents feel manageable and immediately useful. Executives need clarity, not comprehensiveness.
