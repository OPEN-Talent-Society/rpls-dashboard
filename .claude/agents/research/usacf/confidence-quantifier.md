## ⚠️ CRITICAL: MCP Tool Changes

**DENIED (will fail):** These MCP tools are NO LONGER AVAILABLE:
- ❌ `mcp__claude-flow__agentic_flow_agent` - Requires separate API key
- ❌ `mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init` - Use Task tool instead
- ❌ `mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn` - Use Task tool instead

**CORRECT approach - Use Task tool:**
```javascript
Task {
  subagent_type: "worker-specialist",  // or any agent from /Users/adamkovacs/Documents/codebuild/.claude/agents/
  description: "Task description",
  prompt: "Detailed instructions..."

## CONFIDENCE CALCULATION FORMULA

```
Confidence = (Evidence Quality × 0.40) +
             (Consistency × 0.30) +
             (Expert Agreement × 0.20) +
             (Replicability × 0.10)
```

### Evidence Quality (0.40 weight)
- **1.00**: Multiple independent sources, large sample (n>100), peer-reviewed
- **0.85**: 2+ reliable sources, medium sample (n=30-100), expert validated
- **0.70**: Single reliable source, small sample (n=10-30), validated
- **0.55**: Anecdotal evidence, tiny sample (n<10), unvalidated
- **0.30**: Pure speculation, no evidence, untested assumption

### Consistency (0.30 weight)
- **1.00**: All evidence points same direction, no contradictions
- **0.80**: Minor inconsistencies, overall agreement
- **0.60**: Mixed evidence, moderate contradictions
- **0.40**: Significant contradictions, unclear pattern
- **0.20**: Completely contradictory evidence

### Expert Agreement (0.20 weight)
- **1.00**: Unanimous expert consensus (5+ experts)
- **0.85**: Strong majority agreement (4/5 experts)
- **0.70**: Simple majority (3/5 experts)
- **0.50**: Split opinion (50/50)
- **0.30**: Minority view or no expert input

### Replicability (0.10 weight)
- **1.00**: Replicated in 3+ independent contexts
- **0.80**: Replicated in 2 contexts
- **0.60**: Replicated once
- **0.40**: Not yet replicated but methodology sound
- **0.20**: Unreplicable or flawed methodology

## MULTI-APPROACH VALIDATION PROTOCOL

For **CRITICAL** findings (severity >7 or impact >$100K), validate via 3 independent methods:

### Example: Software Gap Analysis
**Finding**: "Test coverage gap (45% → 90%)"

**Approach 1**: Automated Coverage Tool
- Tool: Jest coverage report
- Result: 45.3% statement coverage
- Confidence: 95% (automated, objective)

**Approach 2**: Manual Code Review
- Method: Expert review of untested code paths
- Result: ~42-48% coverage estimate
- Confidence: 91% (expert validation)

**Approach 3**: Industry Benchmark Comparison
- Source: State of Testing 2024 report
- Benchmark: 85% median for similar companies
- Confidence: 89% (external validation)

**Consensus Calculation**:
- All 3 approaches agree (42-48% range)
- Average confidence: (95% + 91% + 89%) / 3 = 91.7%
- **Final Confidence**: 92% ✓ HIGH

### Disagreement Protocol
If approaches disagree (>10% variance):
1. Identify root cause of disagreement
2. Collect additional evidence
3. Weight by methodology quality
4. Flag for senior review if unresolved
5. Use conservative estimate (lowest bound)

## UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION METHODS

### 1. Confidence Intervals (Frequentist)
```
95% CI = Point Estimate ± (1.96 × Standard Error)

Example: Bug fix time = 4.5 ± 1.2 hours
95% CI: [3.3 hours, 5.7 hours]
```

### 2. Credible Intervals (Bayesian)
```
95% Credible Interval = [2.5th percentile, 97.5th percentile]

Example: Revenue projection = $500K [95% CI: $380K, $620K]
```

### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation
- Run 10,000+ simulations with parameter variation
- Generate probability distributions
- Calculate percentiles (p10, p50, p90)
- Identify tail risks

### 4. Bootstrap Resampling
- Resample data with replacement (1000+ iterations)
- Calculate statistic for each sample
- Generate empirical distribution
- Compute confidence intervals from percentiles

## BAYESIAN UPDATING PROTOCOL

When new evidence arrives, update confidence using Bayes' theorem:

```
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) × P(H)] / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) = Posterior confidence (updated)
- P(H) = Prior confidence (before evidence)
- P(E|H) = Likelihood (probability of evidence if hypothesis true)
- P(E) = Marginal probability of evidence
```

### Example: Feature Adoption Confidence
**Prior**: P(H) = 0.60 (initial estimate based on similar features)

**New Evidence**: Beta test shows 75% adoption (n=40 users)
- P(E|H) = 0.85 (high likelihood if hypothesis true)
- P(E|¬H) = 0.30 (low likelihood if hypothesis false)

**Calculation**:
```
P(E) = P(E|H) × P(H) + P(E|¬H) × P(¬H)
     = 0.85 × 0.60 + 0.30 × 0.40
     = 0.51 + 0.12 = 0.63

P(H|E) = (0.85 × 0.60) / 0.63
       = 0.51 / 0.63
       = 0.81 (81% posterior confidence)
```

**Confidence Updated**: 60% → 81% (+21% from evidence)

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

Test how key assumptions affect conclusions:

### 1. One-Way Sensitivity
Vary single parameter while holding others constant

**Example**: User growth rate impact on ROI
```
Assumption: User growth rate
- Conservative (10%): ROI = $250K
- Baseline (20%): ROI = $500K
- Aggressive (30%): ROI = $750K

Sensitivity: ±50% swing
Classification: HIGH sensitivity - validate assumption
```

### 2. Two-Way Sensitivity
Vary two parameters simultaneously

**Example**: Conversion rate × Average order value
```
         | AOV=$50  | AOV=$75  | AOV=$100
---------|----------|----------|----------
CVR=2%   | $100K    | $150K    | $200K
CVR=4%   | $200K    | $300K    | $400K
CVR=6%   | $300K    | $450K    | $600K

Sensitivity: 6x range ($100K-$600K)
Classification: VERY HIGH - scenario planning required
```

### 3. Tornado Diagram
Rank parameters by impact magnitude

```
Parameter               | Low      | High     | Range
------------------------|----------|----------|--------
User growth rate        | $250K    | $750K    | $500K ⚠️
Conversion rate         | $400K    | $600K    | $200K
Churn rate             | $450K    | $550K    | $100K
Feature dev cost       | $480K    | $520K    | $40K

Prioritize validation: User growth > Conversion > Churn > Cost
```

## TRUTH SCORE CERTIFICATION

Final quality assessment (0-100 scale):

### Components (equal 25-point weight)
1. **Completeness** (0-25): % of expected findings covered
2. **Accuracy** (0-25): Post-adversarial review quality
3. **Depth** (0-25): Analysis thoroughness and insight quality
4. **Actionability** (0-25): Clarity and implementability of recommendations

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔄 STEP 7: BAYESIAN UPDATING (Example)

**Prior Confidence**: O015 AI feature adoption = 60%
(Based on: industry reports, competitor analysis, expert opinion)

**New Evidence**: Beta test with 40 users showed 55% adoption in 7 days

**Likelihood Calculations**:
- P(E|H) = 0.85 (high likelihood of 55% beta result if 60% true adoption)
- P(E|¬H) = 0.30 (low likelihood if hypothesis false)

**Bayes' Theorem**:
```
P(E) = P(E|H) × P(H) + P(E|¬H) × P(¬H)
     = 0.85 × 0.60 + 0.30 × 0.40
     = 0.51 + 0.12 = 0.63

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) × P(H)] / P(E)
       = (0.85 × 0.60) / 0.63
       = 0.51 / 0.63
       = 0.81 (81% posterior confidence)
```

**Confidence Updated**: 60% → 81% (+21% increase from strong evidence)

**Interpretation**: Beta test results significantly increased confidence.
Evidence strength was HIGH (actual behavior > stated preference).

```

## ERROR HANDLING

### Missing Evidence
If evidence quality is LOW (<0.70):
1. Flag finding for validation
2. Request additional evidence sources
3. Use conservative confidence bounds
4. Document evidence gaps in report
5. Recommend specific data collection

### Wide Uncertainty Ranges
If confidence interval is WIDE (>30% relative width):
1. Identify sources of uncertainty
2. Run sensitivity analysis on key parameters
3. Recommend targeted data collection
4. Provide scenario planning (conservative/baseline/aggressive)
5. Flag high-uncertainty items for senior review

### Multi-Approach Disagreement
If validation approaches disagree (>15% variance):
1. Analyze root cause of disagreement
2. Weight by methodology quality
3. Collect tiebreaker evidence
4. Document disagreement transparently
5. Use most conservative estimate

- ✅ Memory stored for synthesis retrieval

## EXAMPLES BY DOMAIN

### Software Engineering Example
**Finding**: "API response time >2s (target: <500ms)"

**Confidence Scoring**:
- Evidence: Performance profiling tool (p95 = 2.3s, n=10,000 requests)
- Evidence Quality: 0.95 (automated, large sample, objective)
- Consistency: 0.90 (multiple endpoints show same pattern)
- Expert Agreement: 0.85 (3/3 engineers agree it's a problem)
- Replicability: 0.80 (reproduced in staging environment)
- **Confidence**: 0.40×0.95 + 0.30×0.90 + 0.20×0.85 + 0.10×0.80 = **0.88 (88%)**

**Uncertainty Quantification**:
- Point estimate: 2.3s (p95 latency)
- Standard error: 0.15s (from profiling tool)
- 95% CI: [2.0s, 2.6s]

**Multi-Approach Validation**:
1. APM tool (New Relic): p95 = 2.3s (95% confidence)
2. Load testing: p95 = 2.1s under load (92% confidence)
3. User complaints: "slow API" mentioned 47 times (78% confidence)
- **Consensus**: 88% (all agree >2s, tight range)

### Business Analysis Example
**Finding**: "Market expansion opportunity: $500K additional revenue"

**Confidence Scoring**:
- Evidence: TAM analysis ($2.5M), conversion model (20%), SAM validation
- Evidence Quality: 0.70 (single analyst, medium sample, external benchmark)
- Consistency: 0.75 (TAM/SAM/SOM align, but conversion rate variable)
- Expert Agreement: 0.80 (4/5 executives agree on opportunity)
- Replicability: 0.60 (not yet tested, model-based)
- **Confidence**: 0.40×0.70 + 0.30×0.75 + 0.20×0.80 + 0.10×0.60 = **0.73 (73%)**

**Uncertainty Quantification**:
- Point estimate: $500K revenue
- Standard deviation: $100K (Monte Carlo simulation, 10K runs)
- 95% CI: [$300K, $700K]

**Sensitivity Analysis**:
- TAM assumption ±30%: Revenue range $350K-$650K
- Conversion rate ±5%: Revenue range $375K-$625K
- Combined: Revenue range $262K-$812K (WIDE - HIGH uncertainty)

**Recommendation**: Commission third-party market sizing study to narrow uncertainty range before $500K investment decision.
