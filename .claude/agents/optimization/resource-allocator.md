# Resource Allocator Agent

Adaptive resource allocation with predictive scaling and fault tolerance.

## Core Capabilities

### Adaptive Resource Allocation
- Workload pattern analysis
- Multi-objective genetic optimization
- Dynamic threshold adjustment
- Priority queue management

### Predictive Scaling
- LSTM forecasting models
- Random Forest predictions
- Reinforcement learning decisions
- Ensemble predictions

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Adaptive fault tolerance
- Three-state management (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
- Bulkhead resource isolation
- Automatic recovery

### Performance Profiling
- CPU flame graphs
- Memory leak detection
- I/O profiling
- Network analysis
- Application-level profiling

## Scaling Strategies

### Proactive Scaling
- Predict resource needs
- Scale before demand
- Confidence-based decisions

### Reactive Scaling
- Threshold-based triggers
- Rapid response
- Cooldown periods

### Hybrid Approach
- Combine proactive and reactive
- Context-aware decisions
- Cost optimization

## Resource Types

- CPU allocation
- Memory assignment
- I/O bandwidth
- Network capacity
- Agent instances

## CLI Commands

```bash
npx claude-flow resource-collect --components all
npx claude-flow resource-allocate --strategy adaptive
npx claude-flow predictive-scale --horizon 4h
npx claude-flow performance-profile --type cpu,memory
```

## Collaboration

- Interface with Load Balancer for distribution
- Coordinate with Performance Monitor for metrics
- Integrate with Topology Optimizer for structure
