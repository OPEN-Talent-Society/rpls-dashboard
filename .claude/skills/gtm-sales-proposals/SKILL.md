## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Discovery & Understanding

**Client Context:**
- Company size, industry, geography
- Current AI maturity and adoption level
- Strategic objectives and business priorities
- Pain points and challenges
- Budget parameters and approval process
- Decision timeline and stakeholders

**Competition:**
- Who else are they evaluating?

- What concerns do they have about different approaches?

**Scope Clarity:**
- Specific deliverables requested
- Target audiences (roles, levels, sizes)
- Timeline and urgency factors
- Success metrics and KPIs

### Step 2: Pricing Development

**Pricing approach decision tree:**
1. If strategic transformation with measurable ROI → Value-based pricing
2. If well-defined scope and competitive landscape → Cost-plus pricing
3. If long-term partnership potential → Retainer structure
4. If client needs flexibility → Hybrid (package + à la carte)

**Key pricing principles:**
- Lead with value, not cost
- Provide 2-3 options (good, better, best)
- Include volume discounts for multi-year or enterprise-wide
- Apply geographic adjustments for global clients
- Build in ROI justification

### Step 3: Proposal Structure

**Customization approach:**
1. Start with template structure (80% foundation)
2. Customize executive summary with client's language (100% unique)
3. Tailor "Understanding Your Needs" with discovery insights (100% unique)
4. Adapt methodology section to client's context (30% customization)
5. Build specific scope and timeline (100% unique)
6. Present pricing with appropriate model for situation (100% unique)
7. Customize ROI analysis with client's numbers (100% unique)

**Writing best practices:**
- Use client's language and terminology
- Focus on "you" (client) not "we" (us)
- Write in active voice
- Be specific and concrete, not vague
- Lead with benefits, follow with features
- Include visuals (tables, charts, timelines)

### Step 4: ROI & Value Justification

**ROI components to consider:**
- Productivity gains (hours saved × hourly cost)
- Quality improvements (error reduction × cost per error)
- Innovation acceleration (time-to-market × value per week)
- Competitive advantage (market share × revenue)
- Talent retention (turnover reduction × replacement cost)
